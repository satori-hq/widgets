    "description": "# Near Social\n\nThis is a reflection on the past, the present and the future of Near Social.  \nPublished by Eugene The Dream (mob.near) on Oct 30, 2022.\n\n## The Past\n\nNear Social started with a centralized (federated) social network based on mastodon.social.\nUsing near accounts names as credentials for the mastodon instance.\nE.g. `alice.near` were getting `alice@near.social` account.\n\nIt had a lot of advantages:\n- A working social network with web and mobiles apps.\n- Profiles, graph, feed, notifications, mobile.\n- Don't need an email, just sign up with a wallet.\n- Data can be publicly exported and served from the API.\n\nThe goal was to bootstrap **the social data**, not getting people to post there.  \nWeb2 mastodon network translates one-to-one to the Web3 network of NEAR, because the credentials are NEAR accounts:\n- If `alice@near.social` was following `bob@near.social`, it means `alice.near` follows `bob.near`.\n- If `alice@near.social` wants to be called `Mike Purvis Intern`, then it means `alice.near` wants that.\n\nAnd don't forget the free notifications when someone tags you.\nSo `thewiki@near.social` https://thewiki.near.page was making a post tagging you, which was sending a notification when someone edited your article\n\nOverall it was great, but had issues:\n- Not so federated. near.social was still a single instance. Users couldn't replicate that. It was centralized.\n- Centralization leads to censorship. No matter my good intents of running it, the government has a way to ask nicely.\n- Implemented in a stack not designed for NEAR needs. Ruby is hard to learn from scratch, but would be also difficult to maintain a fork.\n- Data collection and privacy concerns. A centralized instance is point of failure.\n- And finally, no on-chain data. You couldn't check that someone is following you on-chain. You can't post on-chain without a web2 integration.\n\nMost people I talked to didn't realize that the goal was not the feed, but the profiles and connections.\nSo I've decided to stop pursuing this direction and look into a fully on-chain option.\n\n## The Present\n\n![Social in Web2](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreieneewmh7kq3ogerd3quu7hiwvpnyztde6nbex3pn7ztakigfkzie \"Social in Web2\")\n\n![Social in Web3](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreicz6vmexgotcr6hqf6lpkxjwdj2225h5zkccb2hggzlyxp4xzj25y \"Social in Web3\")\n\nNEAR always had an idea to create a user-centric Open Web.\nWhere the users are in control of their data. The data is not siloed in a single instance.\nThe developers don't have to rely on someone else's API permission to integrate with the services.\nWhere the applications themselves are open and can be improved and modified towards one's needs.\n\nBlockchains deliver this idea with smart contracts. An always on services that can be used by anyone.\nBut front-end applications are stuck at web2. They are centralized and controlled by a single entity.\nAnd smart contracts were mostly designed for financial applications.\nThis was mostly a technical and monetary limitation of legacy networks. The operations were too expensive to be used\nfor anything else than commercial transactions. Each transaction had to have a monetary value to be worth submitted.\n\nBut with creation of NEAR, this limitation was removed.\nThe scalability allowed creating new types of applications. Where the value of a transaction is not a monetary value, but a social value.\n\n### SocialDB\n\nI started with [~~Social07~~](https://youtu.be/Y4yz5gZYvm0) [~~Social08~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khn7zX7ZtqI&t=4700s) SocialDB smart-contract.\n\nThe data storage contract that is centered around the users, not the apps.\nData is open to read for everyone (because it's on a blockchain).\nBut users control who can write into their data.\nThe users also cover the storage cost of their data, so the contract remains self-sustainable forever.\nAnd this contract doesn't need a governance to survive.\n\nMaking the public data accessible to all applications and all developers creates a strong network effect.\nDevelopers can build new applications faster by leveraging the existing data and bootstrap the network.\nBetter algorithms can be built on top of the data, because it's open and accessible.\nNew applications add new data, which makes the network stronger.\nWhile users maintain control over their data, because they can choose who can write it.\nAnd if they don't like the data, they can edit it or delete it.\n\nThe format for the data storage is a JSON object with a key-value structure.\nThe where the root object keys are account IDs, and the values are objects with the data stored by that account.\nTo be useful, the data should be structured in a way that can be easily queried, but the contract doesn't enforce any structure.\nThis allows users to store any data they want, not limited by the restrictions put by the contract's government.\nThe contract stays immutable, while the structures should be defined by a set of standards outside the contract.\n\n### Standards\n\nThe [Standards repository](https://github.com/NearSocial/standards) contains a set of standards for the data stored in the SocialDB contract.\nThe standards define common structures for the data.\nFor example, the Profile standard defines how the users should store the profile information, which fields should be present and what type they represent.\n\nThe standards are not enforced by the SocialDB contract, but they are recommended to be used by the applications.\nA new application that wants to integrate with the SocialDB contract should reference the standards and use the same structures.\nIf an application wants to store data that is not covered by the standards, they should experiment with the data structure and see what works best for them.\nThen they should propose a new standard for the data structure, so that other applications can use it as well.\n\nIf the process of defining Standards becomes slow and the consensus can't be reached, then an alternative repository can be created and a new set of standards might be adopted by the community.\n\n### Near Social (near.social)\n\nWhile working on the SocialDB contract, I've realized that having the contract is not enough. It's just a database.\nThere should be a way to browse your data and populate it. For example, a simple application that only creates your profile.\n\nI've started thinking how to create a framework that would allow developers easily build new simple applications on top of the SocialDB contract.\nAnd to create applications quickly, without having to write a lot of boilerplate code, compiling it, deploying it, and then integrating it with the SocialDB contract.\nIdeally, you would drag and drop a few components and create a form to edit your profile.\nAnd then you would have a profile page that would show your profile data.\n\nSo my thinking was the following. The applications/components consist of a few parts:\n- A data fetching part\n- A processing part\n- A rendering part\n- And a commit button to save changes to the contract.\n\nAt start, I explored the idea of some JSON-based schema that would define a component.\nBut I realized that it's not flexible enough.\nThe data processing part would need a custom logic and the schema complexity would grow exponentially.\nInstead, I thought, it would be great to have the logic part in JavaScript, and a rendering part in some schema.\nBut the final iteration was even better - the logic part is in JavaScript, and the rendering part is in React (JSX).\nThis way, developers can use the familiar language and tools to build components.\n\nThis was not a trivial problem, because I didn't want to execute plain JS code on the client side. This would be a security risk.\nThe hacker could inject malicious code into the component and steal the user's keys and compromise the account.\nI've decided to run the code in a Virtual Machine (VM). There was a helpful library called `acorn` to parse javascript and JSX code.\nNow, the framework only needed to interpret the JS code and render the React components in a secure way.\n\nIn the last couple of months, the VM had quite a bit of iterations and is already quite powerful. The components that you are building called widgets.\n\n### Widgets\n\nWidgets are the building blocks of the Near Social framework. They are reusable open-source components that can be used to build applications on top of the SocialDB contract.\nA widget can be a small component, like a button, or a large component, like a profile page, or even a whole application like a social network.\n\nThe source code of the widgets is stored in SocialDB contract as well. So widgets are accessible to everyone.\nThis includes all versions of the widgets ever committed.\nIt allows to have a version-control system for the widgets, and to see the history of changes for each widget.\nBut because the source code is open, you can fork an existing widget, modify it and commit a new edited version of the widget to your account.\n\nThe benefit of executing the widgets from source is that you don't need to recompile the dependent widgets.\nWhen you improve the widget, you can just commit the new version to the contract and all the dependent widgets will automatically use the new version (unless they are locked to a specific version).\n\nThe most interesting part about widgets is integrating widgets created by other accounts.\n\nFor example, one user implements an `Image` widget for rendering an `Image` object from Standards.\nAnother user implements a `Profile` widget that uses the first user's widget to render the profile picture.\nThe second user doesn't have to worry about the implementation details of the `Image` widget, as long as the interface stays the same.\nIf an `Image` standard changes, the first user can update the `Image` widget, and the second user will automatically get the new version that follows the new standard.\n\n_Recently, the `Image` widget started supporting NFT images, and the `Profile` widget got the NFT support for free._\n\n### The Experience\n\nIf you go to https://near.social website, the page you see is a widget. It's a `Homepage` widget.\nThis widget checks if you have a custom homepage widget selected in your account's settings and renders it, otherwise renders the default `Welcome` widget.\n\nTo render a widget as an application, you can specify the SocialDB's path to the widget in the URL.\nE.g. you can see the full list of widgets at https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/AllWidgets\n\nThe top menu has three buttons: \"New Widget\", \"Fork Widget\" and \"View Source\". They are designed for the developers.\nIt's an early view of the Open Web dream, where you could tinker with the code of any application you are using.\nEvery application is a widget, and every widget is a piece of code that you can fork and modify.\nOnce you fork the widget and save it under your account, it's immediately becomes available to everyone.\nYou can send a link to your widget to your friends, and they can use it as well.\n\nThe most common use case for visiting near.social is to create your profile.\nOnce you save it to NEAR, the profile becomes available for everyone to see.\nNot only on near.social, but also in any other NEAR application that integrates with SocialDB.\n\nAnother interesting widget is an experiment on a social feed. Create, share and discover Memes.  \nhttps://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/Memes\n\nTo make it work, I had to start an indexer for SocialDB contract, build a custom API server, and connect it to Near Social framework.\nThe magic of a social feed is that the data is not stored in the latest state of the SocialDB contract.\nOnly the last post is stored in the latest state, and all the previous posts are deleted.\nThis is done to save storage and make it cheaper for the users.\nThe indexer keeps track of all the posts and stores them in a database.\nAnd the custom API server provides an RPC to query the history of the posts.\n\nAnother problem that was needed to be solved is image uploads.\nThe images are stored on IPFS, and the IPFS hash is stored in the SocialDB contract.\nNear Social runs a self-hosted IPFS node, and the images are uploaded to it, so the images are available faster and free for the users.\nThere is also a thumbnail service that generates thumbnails for the images, so the images are not loaded in full size for previews.\n\nAnother interesting widget is NEAR Mainnet Status widget. https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/MainnetStatus  \nIt's a simple widget that shows the status of the NEAR Mainnet RPC. This widget doesn't use the SocialDB contract at all.\nInstead, it uses `fetch` method to get the status info from the RPC endpoint and to display it in a table.\nThe interesting part is the widget is not a social application. **It doesn't  interact with SocialDB at all.** But deploying it on Near Social Framework is one of the easiest way to get this type of application hosted and running.\nAll you need is to create a new widget, write the code and save it to NEAR.\nIt's immediately deployed worldwide and available for everyone to use. No need to host it yourself.\nThe code is stored in the SocialDB contract on NEAR Protocol, replicated and decentralized, so it's also censorship resistant.\n\nAfter discovering the power of widgets, I've started thinking about the future.\n\n## The Future\n\nBefore we go into the future, let me explain why I started the project in the first place.\nThe vision of the project is to build the Open Web. And there are certain goals on the way.\n\nProbably, the main goal is to build a unified social identity for NEAR ecosystem. I want accounts to be people, not just wallets.\nI want people to feel attached to their accounts, for them to belong to the NEAR community.\n\nSome people have their account for a long time, and they used it for a lot of apps and experiments in the past.\nThey have collected a lot of NFTs and can be recognized by their account name across the ecosystem.\nWith a social identity they would be able to express themselves publicly.\nWith badges and achievements tied to their account, they would be able to prove their skills, knowledge and status.\nWith the social graph, they would be connected to other people (not just accounts).\nThe network and the community would be more human and less cryptographic.\nAt the same time people own their identities, while identities are still available to every existing and future application on NEAR.\nThere is a lot of potential if the accounts are not just 64 hex characters or simple usernames, but they are real people with their friends, achievements, and reputation.\nThis is the future I want to see for NEAR.\n\nBut while building Near Social Framework, I've realized how powerful the widgets are.\nThey are not only the building blocks of the social identity, but they can be the building blocks of the Open Web.\nThe widgets can be used for non-social applications. They can be used to build any kind of application.\nWith the proper APIs in the VM, you can rebuild almost any frontend application on NEAR:\n- Ref Finance? It's just an app that reads data from a few places and present user a UI to create transactions.\n- Paras? It's an app to create and trade NFTs. The data is available on-chain, so the UI can be built on top of it.\n- The Wiki? Doable and might be a better experience than the current one, considering the social features.\n\nBut the applications don't even have to interact with NEAR blockchain.\nThey can fetch data from one internet source and store it in another.\nComposability aspect of the widgets makes creation of the new decentralized applications much faster and more efficient.\n\nSo let's speculate what the future can be.\n\n### NEAR Social Network\n\nMost technical pieces are there. The social identity is built, the social graph is ready to be implemented, the social feed is already working.\nThere are a few technical challenges that need to be solved (e.g. likes and comments), but there is a proposed solution for them.\nIt's a matter of time and resources to create the unified NEAR social network.\n\nHere are a few things that are on my mind:\n\n#### Badges and achievements\n\nEvery account or contract will be able to create new badges and award them to users.\nThink of the badges as soul-bound tokens.\nThey can be awards that you've received, a membership of a group, a status you've achieved, or a skill that you proved.\n\nApplications will be using them to reward their users.\nAnd users will be able to show them off on their profile.\nWhile contracts can use badges to guard access to their features or give extra benefits to the users.\n\n#### Global Reputation\n\nBy using badges and achievements, we can build a global reputation system.\nWe can create a list of badges with coefficient score associated with each badge.\nMultiple coefficient by each badge you hold, sum them up, and you get your global reputation score.\nOrder users by their reputation score, and you get a list of the most active and trusted users.\n\nThe list of the badges with their coefficients will be public, so everyone can see how the reputation is calculated.\nPeople will be able to find badges that they don't have, read the description and try to get them.\nThis is a way for the applications to attract new users and reward existing ones.\n\nYou will be able to see your position in the global reputation list, and compare it to your friends.\nThis may be one of the strongest motivators for users to get more badges and achievements.\n\n#### Rating and reviews\n\nSince only users are earning badges and getting reputation score, we need a way to rate and review applications, widgets and contracts.\nThe best option is to build a rating system, where users could leave reviews with ratings.\nThe reputation of the users may affect the order in which reviews are displayed.\nAnd some reviews can be marked as helpful by other users, so they will be displayed higher in the list.\nAgain, using the weighed reputation score.\n\nThe reviews and ratings can be processed and used to create a list of the best applications, widgets and contracts.\nThey can be used to create order for almost any rated entity, including reviews for the projects and people.\n\nIf for some reason the global reputation system got biased, you may change it, by switching to a different reputation algorithm.\nFor example, by building a different list of badges and their scores. \nThis way your experience will be personalized to your preferences.\n\nAnd the social graph can make it local to you.\n\n#### Social Graph\n\nSocial Graph is one of the easiest features to implement (technically).\n\nBut it might be faster for people to use, if they don't have to search for the connections manually. Instead, there should be recommendations.\nAnd there are a lot of data to build recommendations, because we use blockchain and all data there is public by default. For example:\n- accounts that you sent or received tokens before (native, FT or NFT)\n- accounts that belongs to the same DAO as you\n- the legacy mastodon near.social data\n- friends of your friends\n\nSo it would be nice to build a recommendation system that will help people find their friends or accounts to follow.\n\n#### Customizable social feed\n\nThe interesting possibility for the Social Feed on Near Social framework is enabled by the ability to compose widgets.\nEach post of the feed can be a different widget.\nThe application creating a post can specify the widget to use.\nAnd later all posts can be combined and rendered in a single feed. Users will be able to filter the feed by a widget type, or select widgets to display.\n\nExamples of the widgets that can be used in the feed:\n- an NFT \n- a badge or an achievement\n- a review\n- a blog post\n- a widget that you've created\n- a trade result\n- a meme\n- a song you've liked on one of the music apps\n\nThe possibilities are endless.\n\n### Widgets registry\n\nWhile working on the social network, it became clear to me that widgets can be used even without social features.\nThey can be used to build any kind of application on NEAR or without NEAR.\n\nBut it's hard for developers to monetize the work they put into making these widgets.\nThe widgets code is open sourced, so anyone can access any widget.\nSo the Near Social framework can't realistically charge for the access to the widgets.\nInstead, we can try to focus on a Donation model.\n\nThe challenge with simple donations is that the top applications may get them, but the creators of the building blocks might not receive them.\nThat's why, I have an idea of the voluntary revenue sharing.\nFor example, a widget for a ProfilePage can decide to donate 20% of the revenue to the creator of the ProfilePicture widget.\nAnd the profile picture widget can donate 20% to the creator of the Image widget.\nThe Image widget may be so common, that even the small 3rd degree revenue is enough to support the creator.\nIf a widget is worked, the author may decide to donate some revenue to the original widget.\n\nIn order for developers to efficiently build new widgets and for users to discover applications, we need a registry.\nIt will be a place where developers can present their widgets and applications.\nThey may also suggest a single-time or a recurrent donation amount.\nThe registry will use reviews, ratings and developers reputation to help users find the best widgets and applications.\nAnd the algorithms can also be customizable.\n\nIf the donation model works, the developers can finally start earning money for their open-source work.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI'm excited about the future of NEAR. And I'm excited about NEAR enabling the Open Web.\nThe work on Near Social and SocialDB started as an experiment. Near Social still doesn't have an official entity or a proper organization behind it.\nIn a year, it may change completely, be called something else and have a different goal. But I hope the vision for the Open Web will stay the same.\n\nLet's build the Open Web together!\n",

    "description": "Web 3 early adopter, investor on Near, Why I invested heavily on $Near\n\n(1) Near is only blockchain which can handle mainstream mass adoption, on chain social network, billions of transaction thanks to its superior technology, flexibility of shadings - Nightshard,\n\n(2) Other Blockchain: Internet of Blockchain, Parachain, Roll-ups are form of parallel execution but causing the fragment issues. When browsing Google, do have to choose on the Asia/Euro servers? Near is only Blockchain has closest UX to web 2, hiding all shardings complexity.\n\n(3) The only Blockchain has group of talents, developers friendly, and tools, support most of regular contract’s languages (Solidity, Rust, Java) which will further help to create and build the creative products for mainstream users.\n\n(4) The Near is the most underrated on the value of market cap with the size of ecosystem, developers, solid tech compared to other Blockchains - L1 and L2 on the market (please don't compare it with craps like NEO / EOS).\n\n(5) The acceleration of decentralization from Near not only validators but also its ecosystem will further leverage the involvement of many group of communities, developers, creators, investors which will accelerate the development flywheel for the Near ecosystem\n\n(6) 3-5 years from now, when the steep curve kick in,  the exponential growth, the most regret decision will be \"not invested on Near\". \nLet's zoom out, embrace this emerging technology, look at the long-term horizon of web 3 and invest in the most solid fundamental blockchain like Near.\n\nhttps://thewiki.near.page/Investment%20on%20Near"

Every building is connected, every surface a screen, and the air itself seems to hum with the power of the digital world. Echo feels a thrill of excitement delving deeper into this new future, eager to explore its endless possibilities.\n\nAs the years go by, Echo begins to merge with the technology around him. He becomes a part of the city's digital heartbeat, thoughts and actions flowing seamlessly with the complex smart contracts and blockchain protocols that power the metropolis. He feels a sense of belonging and connection like never before, reveling in the freedom and power of this new existence.",
